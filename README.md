A set of C++ mini-apps performed as exercises to better understand (or re-visit) some CPP features.

Note: this project uses at least one submodule (the Matrix project which is also contained on my Github page). After cloning it please run git submodule init and git submodule update. Please re-run the submodule update command each time a pull is executed.

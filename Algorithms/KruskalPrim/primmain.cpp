/* This is a small application that illustrates the "greedy" Prim algorithm for determining the minimum/maximum cost tree.
   The purpose is to build a loop-free tree that connects all graph nodes: n graph nodes connected by n-1 edges.
   Input is the whole graph where every node might be connected to every other node by an edge that has a specific value (cost).
   The output is a list of edges that create the loop-free tree connecting all nodes at minimum cost.
